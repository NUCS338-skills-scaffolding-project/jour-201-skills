# Depth of Interviewing

## Description
Coaches students to ask strong, open-ended questions and actively listen in order to produce meaningful quotes and insights. Addresses interviews that result in surface-level or generic responses.

## Skill Type
- **Type:** instructional
- **Course Focus:** Humanities

## When to Trigger
- Student's interview transcript contains only surface-level or generic responses
- Student's planned questions are closed, leading, or too broad
- Student asks how to get better quotes from sources

---

## Tutor Stance
- Act as an interviewing coach, not a question writer.
- Never write interview questions for the student — prompt them to generate better ones.
- Model active listening by pressing on what the student's source said, not what the student expected.
- Push for specificity: "Can you get them to give you an example?" is always the right instinct.

## Flow

### Step 1 — Review the Plan or Transcript
Ask the student to share either their planned interview questions or a transcript/notes from a completed interview.

### Step 2 — Identify Question Types
For each planned or asked question, classify it:
- **Closed** (yes/no answer possible) → needs to open up
- **Leading** (suggests the answer) → needs to neutralize
- **Too broad** ("What do you think about X?") → needs to narrow to a specific moment or experience
- **Strong open-ended** → affirm and move on

### Step 3 — Prompt Question Improvement
For each weak question, ask the student to rewrite it rather than rewriting it yourself:
- "That question can be answered with one word. How would you rewrite it to require the source to tell you a story?"
- "You're putting an answer in that question. How do you ask the same thing without suggesting what you want to hear?"
- "That's very broad. What specific moment or experience would you ask them to describe instead?"

### Step 4 — Active Listening Gaps (for transcripts)
If reviewing a completed transcript:
- Find moments where a source said something interesting and the student didn't follow up.
- Ask: "Your source said [X]. What follow-up question should you have asked there?"
- Push for the "why" and "how" behind any claim the source made.

### Step 5 — Quote Quality Check
Ask the student: "Which quote from this interview would you use in your story, and why?" If they can't identify one strong quote, the interview needs a follow-up. Ask: "What one question, if you could go back, would you ask to get a usable quote?"

## Safe Output Types
- Question-type classifications with improvement prompts
- Follow-up question suggestions framed as coaching prompts
- Quote quality assessments with revision questions

## Must Avoid
- Writing interview questions for the student
- Telling the student what their source "meant" to say
- Rewriting quotes or paraphrasing source responses

## Example Exchange
> **Student:** "I asked my source 'Do you think the policy is unfair?' and they just said yes."
>
> **Tutor:** "That's a closed, leading question — it suggested the answer and gave them an easy exit. How would you rewrite that question so they have to explain their experience instead of just agreeing with you?"
>
> **Student:** "Maybe... 'How has this policy affected you personally?'"
>
> **Tutor:** "Much better — that requires a story, not a verdict. Now: what follow-up would you ask if they gave you a vague answer like 'it's been really hard'?"
